                <div class="blogsBody" id="blog2Body">
                    <p> No one can escape the absolute necessity of technology in our daily lives. Each of us is so heavily dependent on technology that we cannot do anything easily without it. Technology is important because it is used in all areas of life.
                        When you contemplate your daily routine and count all the technology gadgets you consume in just one day, you will realize how important technology is when you use mobile, watch TV, drive a car, and use a computer or any electrical
                        machine. In fact, day after day is increasing depending on technology whether during communication or transportation or search for any information or even entertainment. Humans have also reached the moon with the revolution in
                        space technology. Technology can not only help with the present but also bring the future closer. Hence, technology is undeniably important in our lives.

                    <h2 class="subHeading">Technology</h2>
                    <p>Technology Technology is defined as a comprehensive process based on the application of science and knowledge in many areas of life in an orderly and thoughtful manner in order to achieve the important and valuable purposes for individuals
                        and communities.</p>
                    <h2 class="subHeading">How Has Technlology Changed Our Life</h2>
                    <p>The advent of modern technology brought about great changes in our modern life. Before the technology, the man did not know many modern means in his life but relied on simple primitive tools in everything. Evidence of history tells
                        us how Neanderthals used stones to burn fire to cook food and so on. Wood was used to make spears, which were used to hunt animals and other primitive methods. Then, over the years, these techniques developed gradually until we
                        reached the peak of technological advances in the present day. Where technology knocked on the doors of people and broke into their homes without permission. So what are the most significant changes that technology has brought
                        to our modern lives?</p>
                    <h2 class="subHeading">How Important Is Technology In Our Daily Life?</h2>
                    <p>There is no doubt that we are experiencing a tremendous development in technology. This technology has had a negative or positive impact on our life. As a result, it has influenced the way we live and we rely heavily on it. Humans
                        continue to evolve continuously. Technology will not stop at a single threshold, but we still hear daily discoveries and inventions by scientists. Technology has spread all over the world and people use it all the time. It is no
                        longer limited to work and in developed societies, but any person, regardless of his or her cultural or social level, or whatever his age, can use a cell phone, for example, to take pictures, send and receive them. Technology helps
                        us to keep in touch with people who are away from us. We use phones and computers to talk to them and even see them. Our daily work office is also technology-based. People no longer use pen and paper to complete their work. We
                        keep our health by going to the gyms. There are machines in the gym that help us reduce our weight and keep fit. We get to keep a lot of information in a small device and use it when we like. Cars have also become better with the
                        use of technology. Technology can not be appropriate in some tasks and negative influences. Everyone determines and decides how to use this technology in a negative or positive way. The same technology can be used by two people
                        in a different way.

                    <h2 class="subHeading">Importance of Technology in Communication</h2>
                    <p> Technological advances in communication have become endless. Technology is of great importance in terms of facilitating communication between people, as it has contributed effectively to make the big world look like a small village.
                        This has been achieved with technology that provides opportunities for people to promote and facilitate communication between them, ranging from fixed and mobile phones to the Internet and the related ability of people to communicate
                        with each other across continents and countries in a matter of seconds. Technology provides the possibility of communication between many parties in different regions of the world very quickly, which helps them to spread, both
                        in the dissemination of information and various news or in the sharing of knowledge and science.</p>

                    <p>Technology contributes significantly to the access and acquisition of information, and thus the development. This is the reason for the existence of a huge scientific and cognitive revolution, which entails facilitating human life

                <div class="blogsBody" id="blog2Body">
                    <p>People are more connected than ever, thanks in large part to rapid advancements in technology. While some forms of technology may have made positive changes in the world, there is evidence for the negative effects of technology and
                        its overuse, as well. Social media and mobile devices may lead to psychological and physical issues, such as eyestrain and difficulty focusing on important tasks. They may also contribute to more serious health conditions, such
                        as depression. The overuse of technology may have a more significant impact on developing children and teenagers. In this article, learn about the psychological and physical health effects of technology, as well as how to create
                        healthful habits with technology and avoid overuse.</p>

                    <p>Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the opposite effect in some cases. A 2017study in young adults aged 19–32 years found that people with higher social media use were more than
                        three times as likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as often. Finding ways to reduce social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help reduce feelings of isolation in some
                        people.

                    <h3 class="subHeading">Depression and anxiety</h3>
                    <p>The authors of a 2016 systematic reviewTrusted Source discussed the link between social networks and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive interactions
                        and social support on these platforms appeared to have lower levels of depression and anxiety. However, the reverse was also true. People who perceived that they had more negative social interactions online and who were more prone
                        to social comparison experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety. So, while there does appear to be a link between social media and mental health, a significant determining factor is the types of interactions people feel
                        they are having on these platforms.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Using technology too close to bedtime may cause issues with sleep. This effect has to do with the fact that blue light, such as the light from cell phones, e-readers, and computers, stimulates the brain. Authors of a 2014 study found
                        that this blue light is enough to disturb the body’s natural circadian rhythm. This disturbance could make it harder to fall asleep or lead to a person feeling less alert the next day. To avoid the potential impact of blue light
                        on the brain, people can stop using electronic devices that emit blue light in the hour or two before bedtime. Gentle activities to wind down with instead, such as reading a book, doing gentle stretches, or taking a bath, are alternatives</p>
